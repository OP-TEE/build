# OP-TEE on MediaTek 8173 EVB

1. [Introduction](#1-introduction)

3. [External guide](#3-external-guide)

# 1. Introduction
The instructions here will tell how to run OP-TEE using the MTK1873 device.

# 2. Regular build
Start by following the "Get and build the solution" in the [README.md] file.
When everything has been built and it is booting up, it will stop in fastboot
waiting for the binaries. At that point, press reset button and the flashing
procedure should begin.

# 3. External guide
A MediaTek engineer (Howard Chen) has put detailed descriptions on how to
connect the device etc in his [MTK8173 Getting Started] guide. That page also
contains information about how to upgrade the firmware etc. There is also a
link for how to run OP-TEE. We **don't** recommend that you follow that, since
that guide is very old and has been superseded by this particular guide.
